Ina small town a greengrocer had opened a shop that
was located above a deep cellar. Every night, mice came
in droves out of this cellar into the shop. They ate apples
and pears, grapes and nuts and did not spare the
vegetables and potatoes either. No goods that were in the
shop were safe from the small intrusive rodents between
midnight and sunrise. As long as there was noise in the
streets at night and cars were driving by, the mice still
stayed quietly in the cellar. But as soon as the old clock
on the town hall had struck midnight and it became quiet
in the street, they came out in droves, enjoyed the sweet
fruits and celebrated real feasts, whose remains filled the
owner with despair every morning when he entered the
shop. So he tried to protect himself against the mice. At
first he set up traps all over the shop.
